Lit (Launch it) is a simple application launcher written in Java.

## About

After booting their PC, most people will start the same set of apps every time. At work you'll start your email app, other communication apps and a browser - at home you might launch Skype, a music player and Steam.

Lit is an application to define these sets and to start all apps within a set with the click of a button. Simply add some applications, define some sets and add apps to one or multiple sets.

When you launch Lit, just pick the set you want to start and that's it. All applications will be started.
